/*
 * This product's declared feature flags.
 *
 * The standard is explicit that a flag which exists in the database but
 * that nothing reads is worse than useless — it looks like a working
 * control and does nothing. So every key here is read by a helper below
 * it, and the helper is exported for the code that will call it.
 *
 * Registration runs once at boot (see registerFeatureFlags in app.ts). It
 * is idempotent and never overwrites an operator's toggle: `enabled`,
 * `rollout` and `allowlist` are seeded on CREATE only, so a redeploy
 * cannot re-enable something turned off during an incident, nor put back
 * somebody deliberately removed from a pilot.
