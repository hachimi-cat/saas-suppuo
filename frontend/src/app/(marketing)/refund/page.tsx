          <p className="mt-3">
            Suppuo sells access to the platform via monthly and annual subscription
            plans. Subscription fees are charged in advance for the upcoming billing period
            and are non-refundable for the current period once it has started.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            You can cancel a subscription at any time from your dashboard. Cancellation stops
            the next renewal — your access continues to the end of the period you have
            already paid for, and you will not be charged again.

              <strong>Duplicate charges</strong> — if you were charged twice for the same
              period due to a payment-system error, we refund the duplicate within 7 business
              days of confirmation.

              <strong>Service unavailable for &gt;24 consecutive hours</strong> in a billing
              period due to an issue on our side (excluding announced maintenance) — pro-rated
              credit on your next invoice, or a refund on request.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Charged after cancellation</strong> — if a renewal was charged after a
              successful cancellation, we refund in full within 7 business days.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unauthorised charges</strong> — contact support immediately; we work
              with you and the payment provider to resolve and refund where applicable.

            <li>Failure to use the service — no refund for unused time within an active subscription.</li>
            <li>Plan downgrades — the new tier applies from the next renewal; no credit for the higher tier already paid.</li>
            <li>Annual plans cancelled mid-year — cancellation stops the next renewal; the current 12-month period is not refunded.</li>
